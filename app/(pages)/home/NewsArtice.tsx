						In our previous article, “How Does the Bureau of Customs Conduct a
						Post-Clearance Audit? Here’s What Importers Should Expect,” we
						explained how the Bureau of Customs (BOC) conducts a Post-Clearance
						Audit (PCA) from the issuance of an Audit Notification Letter (ANL)
						to the review of import records, findings, and possible demand
						letters for any discrepancies found. We also discussed the roles of
						importers, customs brokers, and the Post Clearance Audit Group
						(PCAG) in ensuring that every step of the process is transparent,
						fair, and compliant with CAO 01-2019. That article showed us that a
						Post-Clearance Audit is not meant to penalize, but to promote
						informed compliance and fair trade practices among importers.  But
						what if an importer discovers an error in their past declaration
						before or even during an audit? This is where the Prior Disclosure
						Program (PDP) becomes crucial. It offers importers an opportunity to
						voluntarily correct mistakes and avoid heavy penalties.
